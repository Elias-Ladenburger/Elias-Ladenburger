Principles

Here are some rules by which I operate (I am likely missing some, but will update this list later as I remember):

Rules 'stolen' from consulting
* always reply within 24 hours (I try to extend this to private messages as well, to keep my social life from dying. I have less time to meet people, the least I can do is reply quickly and keep text conversations going)
   * prefer to reply on same business day
* If 'important' meeting (e.g. first meeting with new client / stakeholder / other relationship): send follow-up on the same day. 
   * always include meeting minutes in this first follow up
   * do not send follow up immediately after the meeting - let a few hours pass to a) indicate that I have other priorities and b) let my thoughts 'stew' for a bit
* keep your own minutes
   * even if other people keep minutes: assume they are missing something that is important to me
   * never send out minutes un-edited. Edit at least for MECE, preferably for hierarchy, priority and sort by action item, decisions and dates
* Take care of appearances: 
   * be slightly better dressed than the client's employees, but not overdressed (unless deliberate, as a tactic - will have to explore this as I dive deeper into sales)
   * have good camera + microphone for remote calls and ALWAYS set up teams / zoom / whatever a few minutes before the call to take care of technical issues
* Keep basic business hygiene: Be punctual, respectful, etc

Rules I gathered from various books
* Trust, but verify
* "Be stubborn on the vision, but flexible on the details" (Jeff Bezos)
  * "Responding to change over following a plan" (Agile Manifesto)
* "Know yourself and know your enemies..." (Sun Tzu)
* „Mr. market is a maniac“ (Ben Graham)
  * more generally: „be contrarian“ (Peter Thiel)
* progress = motivation (Amabile et al.)
* „become someone who is successful in 999/1000 parallel universes“ (Naval Ravikant)
* „control the inputs and the process“ (Andy Grove)
  * corrobated by „the score takes care of itself“ (Jack Walsh)
* Research > Opinion (Peter Ogilvy)
  * corrobated by "In god we trust, all others bring data" (Bezos? He's certainly also a proponent of data-driven decision-making) + Lean Analytics (always forget the authors)
*…more to come 

Rules I learned from (painful) experience
* Discomfort is a small price to pay for (personal) growth
* Don't sign anything on the first meeting
* focus beats hustle
* preparation allows spontaneity
* Micro-management sets standards (deviates from conventional wisdom, but 'avoiding micromanagement' led me to be too hands off)
  * corrobated by 'leadership style laissez-faire is least effective' (empirical finding, got to check the author) and 'micro-management helped Bob Iger turn Disney World Shanghai into a success' (Robert Iger)
* use heuristics for low-stakes stuff, keep cognitive bandwidth for high-stakes stuff (e.g. have 'uniforms' for different context so I don't have to think about what to wear)
  * corrobated by System 1 vs. System 2 (Daniel Kahnemann) and always-black-turtleneck Steve Jobs
* ...others to follow
